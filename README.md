# Crude Oil Fair Value Model Project

This project builds a basic fair value model for crude oil prices using key macroeconomic factors inspired by the "Virtual Barrels" concept. The model incorporates three drivers:

- **USD-CAD exchange rate** — Reflecting Canada’s role as a major U.S. crude supplier.
- **1-year Expected Inflation** — Capturing energy’s influence on consumer price dynamics.
- **Diamondback Energy (FANG) Stock Price** — A proxy for oil-sensitive equities.

Daily-interpolated datasets are merged, visualized, and analyzed using an OLS regression to explore statistical relationships. The project provides a simple, transparent framework to understand how macro factors influence crude oil price movements.
